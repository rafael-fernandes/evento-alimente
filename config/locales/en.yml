    1a_parte: "Helping people achieve happiness, the way she did. With a principle that became an
              ideology, producer and entrepreneur Carolina Guilherme achieved health, and decided that
              was due time that nutritional facts were spread.
          <br>
          <br>
          And so, the ALIMENTE project was born, aiming to nourish the minds of people with
          information about the quality of true food, with trivial and simple preparation for the daily
          routine, in a well-being and healthy lifestyle."
    
    2a_parte: "The project recreates itself in a constant evolution with every event tied to it, adapting the
              reality of the moment, and transmuting itself in special editions, with specific biases and
              different audiences, but never losing the sight of the focus, that is to praise the simple and
              pure human nature and the fullness of life.
          <br>
          <br>
          It’s premiere in an exclusive event in Brasilia made some noise, showing that both creator
          and creature were on the right path, taking renowned Brazilian investigative medicine
          names to a keen select public. The event was such a success that in 2018, it will go beyond
          borders, now reaching for London."
    
    3a_parte: "But it is on the national territory, on our ever-growing restless scenario, that ALIMENTE aims
              to completely change the way of thinking and acting of those that look for a healthier future
              among the daily hardships of the modern world, and with the 1 st International Low Carb
              Congress, a complete game changer bringing to everyone the most notorious food
              philosophy of recent times, featuring international and national icons, presenting healthier
              ways to a better life, gathered in a series of lecture and panels, on their first appearance in
              Brazil.
          <br>
          <br>
          A very warm welcome to our proposal of changing the world through food, science, and
          collaborative awareness."
